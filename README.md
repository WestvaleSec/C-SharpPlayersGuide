# C# Player’s Guide - Progress & Solutions

My personal progress through *The C# Player’s Guide (5th Edition)* by RB Whitaker.  
Includes solutions to coding challenges, notes, and exercises as I learn and level up my C# skills.

## Structure
- Each folder represents a part of the book: The Basics, Object-Oriented Programming, Advanced Features, The Endgame, and Bonus Levels.
- Challenges and exercises within each part earn XP.
- Progress is tracked using XP totals and completion status to show how close I am to leveling up.
- Each level has a total XP target, increasing progressively.

## Current Level
