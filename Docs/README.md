# C# Player’s Guide Progress – WestvaleSec

This repository documents my progress as I work through **_The C# Player’s Guide_**.  
Each challenge, knowledge check, and exercise is completed, organized, and tracked for XP and progression.  
This project is meant to solidify fundamentals, practice consistent version control, and serve as a portfolio of learning.
