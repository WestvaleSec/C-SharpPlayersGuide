/// Challenge 001 – Hello, World!
/// --------------------------------
/// Prompt:
///     You open your eyes and find yourself face down on the beach of a large island, the waves
///     crashing on the shore not far off. A voice nearby calls out, “Hey, you! You’re finally awake!”
///     You sit up and look around. Somehow, opening your IDE has pulled you into the Realms of C#,
///     a strange and mysterious land where it appears that you can use C# programming to solve problems.
///     The man comes closer, examining you. “Are you okay? Can you speak?”
///
///     Creating and running a “Hello, World!” program seems like a good way to respond.
///
/// Objectives:
/// • Create a new Hello World program from the C# Console Application template, targeting .NET 6.
/// • Run your program using any of the three methods described above.
///
/// XP: 50
/// Page: 19
///
/// Notes:
/// Created a new console application that prints “Hello, World!” to the terminal. Verified that
/// the program runs successfully and outputs the expected text to confirm the development
/// environment is properly configured.
///
/// Reflection:
/// Practiced creating, running, and testing a simple C# console application.
/// Understood the compilation and execution process in Visual Studio.
/// </summary>


Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
