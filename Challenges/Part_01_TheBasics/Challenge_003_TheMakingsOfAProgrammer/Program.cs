/// Challenge 003 – The Makings of a Programmer
/// --------------------------------
/// Prompt:
///     The man, who tells you his name is Ritlin, asks you to follow him over to a few of his friends,
///     fishing on the dock. “This one here has the makings of a Programmer!” Ritlin says. The group looks
///     at you with eyes widening and mouths agape. Ritlin turns back to you and continues, “I haven’t seen
///     nor heard tell of anybody who can wield that power in a million clock cycles of the CPU. Nobody has
///     been able to do that since the Uncoded One showed up in these lands.”
///
///     He describes the shadowy and mysterious Uncoded One, an evil power that rots programs and perhaps
///     even the world itself. The Uncoded One’s presence has prevented anybody from wielding the power of
///     programming, the only thing that might be able to stop it. Yet somehow, you have been able to grab
///     hold of this power anyway. Ritlin’s companions suddenly seem doubtful. “Can you show them what you
///     showed me? Use some of that Programming of yours to make a program? Maybe something with more than
///     one statement in it?”
///
/// Objectives:
/// • Make a program with 5 Console.WriteLine statements in it.
/// • Answer this question: How many statements do you think a program can contain?
///
/// XP: 50
/// Page: 24
///
/// Notes:
/// Wrote a program containing five Console.WriteLine statements to display multiple messages.
/// Demonstrated the ability to execute several sequential statements within a single program.
///
/// Reflection:
/// Practiced writing multiple statements in sequence and understood that a program can contain
/// virtually unlimited statements as long as system resources allow.
/// </summary>

// Five Console.WriteLine statements as required by the challenge
Console.WriteLine("This is a program.");
Console.WriteLine("It doesn't do much, but it's a start.");
Console.WriteLine("From here, you can build more complex programs.");
Console.WriteLine("Happy coding!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n");
Console.WriteLine("...\n\n\nactually, I needed one more WriteLine.");
